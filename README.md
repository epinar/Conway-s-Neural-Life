# Conway's Neural Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game where there is a grid and set of rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#cite_note-1

This repository consists of a neural program induction attempt for such a cellular automaton. The rules grow gradually and the feed forward layer captures the Game of Life conditions by solving the multi-label classification problem on predefined labels.

The experiments are applied on a small-fixed grid but there are many other cases that might be interesting to check!
